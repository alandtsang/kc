	Short: "Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector",
	Long: `Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of the arguments may be specified: filenames, resources and names, or
resources and label selector.

Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are
forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to
set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be
acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take
significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must pass a grace period of 0 and specify
the --force flag.`,
